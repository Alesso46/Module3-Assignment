                    <p>Throughout the world, poultry meat consumption continues to 
                        grow, both in developed and in the developing countries. 
                        In 1999, global production of chickens reached 40 billion,
                        and by 2020 this trend is expected to continue to grow, 
                        so that poultry meat will become the consumers’ first choice
                        [1]. Fresh chicken meat and chicken products are universally
                        popular. This occurrence can be explained by the fact that 
                        this meat is not a subject of culturally or religiously set 
                        limitations, and it is perceived as nutritionally valuable 
                        foodstuff with low content of fat, in which there are more 
                        desirable unsaturated fatty acids than in other types of 
                        meat [2, 3]. More importantly, quality poultry products are 
                        available at affordable prices, although their production 
                        costs may vary [4]. If referring to overall consumption of 
                        all types of meat, poultry meat consumption takes one of the
                        leading places in all countries throughout the world [3]. 
                        Such good rating of poultry meat is influenced by many factors,
                        such as short fattening duration, excellent space utilization, 
                        high reproductive ability of poultry, excellent feed conversion,
                        satisfactory nutritional value of poultry meat and relatively 
                        low sales prices. The quality of broiler meat is affected by
                        a number of factors, as follows: fattening system, duration
                        of fattening, hybrid and sex, feeding treatment, handling 
                        before slaughter, freezing of carcasses, storage time, etc.
                        [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. It should be emphasized that 
                        nowadays poultry is fattened in an intensive way, so the
                        stress is an inevitable factor, and the feed, with increased
                        content of microalgae and vegetable and fish oils used to 
                         enrich poultry products with desirable fatty acids, is 
                        susceptible to oxidation [11, 12, 13, 14]. The same as 
                        designed poultry feed mixtures with increased microalgae
                        or oil content, poultry products (meat and eggs) enriched
                        with omega-3 fatty acids are also subjected to oxidation.

                    <p>
                        The production of beef on pasture is one of the potentials 
                        of Brazilian agriculture, mainly due to the territorial extension 
                        and climatic conditions. Therefore, the production of beef on 
                        tropical pastures mainly consists of the use of tropical forages; 
                        when correctly handled, forage plants show good productivity and 
                        improvement in the nutritive value. Among main factors that affect 
                        the performance of beef cattle fed on pastures, the availability 
                        and quality of the pasture stand first. In tropical regions, 
                        during the dry period of the year, the production of forage as 
                        well as its nutritive value is diminished. Hence, it is necessary 
                        to use protein supplements as a feed strategy to promote increased 
                        intake and improved nutrient utilization efficiency by animals. 
                        In view of this, by-products of biodiesel from oilseeds, such as 
                        peanuts, cottonseed and sunflower seeds, with high nutritional 
                        values can be used as an animal feed alternative to the protein 
                        sources commonly used for the formulation of supplements. Protein 
                        supplementation contributes to an increase in live weight gain as 
                        well as improvement in ruminal microbiota activity and, consequently, 
                        potentiates nutrient utilization efficiency in beef cattle fed with 
                        tropical pasture.
